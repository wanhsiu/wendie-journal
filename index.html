            Hi! I'm Wendie. I'm Taiwanese, but grew up in Thailand. I moved to the US for college and have stayed here since.
            I currently live in Brooklyn, New York and I'm in the AAS program in Communications Design. I had my first experience with
            coding last semester in our Core Interaction class. I would still consider myself a beginnner. I am hopig to learn how to 
            create compelling and cool things on the web. Here is an <a href="https://x20xx.com/">Interesting Website</a>.

            I'm trying to figure out what the best way to set up my jounral. The HTML and CSS review was really helpful. I feel like I need to better understand the language of coding instead of 
            just inspecting the page. I never heard of Paul Chan before and after watching his video and reading his "Letter to Young Artist During a Global Pandemic", I found
            his insights very interestig and made me think of creating in a different way. What really stood out to me in the reading is when he said " I'm never quite
            the same after making what ends up mattering the most". Its this idea what when we find meaning and pleasure in doing the things we love it will show in our work in that case it
            wouldn't be seen as "work".

            I found the reading "The Cobweb" by Jill Lepore very interesting and scary at the same time. I didn't know about the Wayback Machine, but reading how it was able to save a screen shot of
            of a very serious matter (Strelkov's VKontakte post about downing the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17) really made me think about privacy and security of the web. I wondering how they are able to collect websites without
            asking and how they get away with archiving it. I used to have a xanga and myspace page back in High School and just thinking about the content and pictures I posted were super embarassing. I tried to look this up on the wayback but luckily it's gone! 
            I do love that you are able to go back and look at old websites that don't exist. It was really interesting to read about the development of the internet and how it started.

            I loved looking through The Rhizome Anthology. There is sometime really interesting about using just html and creating something that reminds me of the "old" web. I also really loved
            how interactive it was by clicking through the pictures and words to create a narrative. The Form Art I also thought was really interesting and fun as well. A website doesn't need to be
            super fancy to be engaging.For the Love Anthology and lo and behold video, it didnt work for me.

            I learned a little about responsive design in our Interaction class last semester. I remember doing a project using media queary, I feel like after looking at more of the tutorials in the links
            provdided, I feel more conformatable using it. I was able to make this journal responsive which I'm really excited about.
