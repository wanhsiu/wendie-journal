      <p> Hi! I'm Wendie. I'm Taiwanese, but grew up in Thailand. I moved to the US for college and have stayed here since.
        I currently live in Brooklyn, New York with my partner and dog (Roscoe). I received a BS in Fashion Design and Merchandising and have been working in 
        the fashion industry for some time, doing everything from styling, ecommerce, and production. I am currently in my 2nd semester in the AAS program in Communications Design
        I had my first experience with coding last semester in our Core Interaction class. I would still consider myself a beginnner. I am hopig to learn how to 
        create something dynamic and compelling on the web. 
        <br>

        Here is an interesting <a href="https://x20xx.com/">website</a></p>

      <p> I'm trying to figure out what the best way to set up my jounral. The HTML and CSS review was really helpful. I feel like I need to better understand the language of coding instead of 
        just inspecting the page. After reading Paul Chan's "Letter to Young Artist During a Global Pandemic", I found his insights very interestig and made me think of creating in a different way. What really stood out to me in the reading is when he said " I'm never quite
        the same after making what ends up mattering the most". Its this idea what when we find meaning and pleasure in doing the things we love it will show in our work in that case it wouldn't be seen as "work". I also found his 
        lecture very intersting and learning about his journey as a designer.

      <p> I found the reading "The Cobweb" by Jill Lepore very interesting and scary at the same time. I didn't know about the Wayback Machine, but reading how it was able to save a screen shot of
        of a very serious matter (Strelkov's VKontakte post about downing the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17) really made me think about privacy and security of the web. I wondering how they are able to collect websites without
        asking and how they get away with archiving it. I used to have a xanga and myspace page back in the day and just thinking about the content and pictures I posted were super embarassing. I tried to look this up on the wayback but luckily it's gone! 
        I do love that you are able to go back and look at old websites that don't exist. It was really interesting to read about the development of the internet and how it started. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I loved looking through The Rhizome Anthology. There is sometime really interesting about using just html and creating something that reminds me of the "old" web. I also really loved
        how interactive it was by clicking through the pictures and words to create a narrative. The Form Art I also thought was really interesting and fun as well. A website doesn't need to be
        super fancy to be engaging.For the Love Anthology and lo and behold video, it didnt work for me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I learned a little about responsive design in our Interaction class last semester. I remember doing a project using media queary, I feel like after looking at more of the tutorials in the links
        provdided, I feel more conformatable using it. I was able to make this journal responsive which I'm really excited about.

      <p> The article "The internet didn't kill counterculture- you just won't find it on Instagram" by Caroline Busta was a 
        interesting read and it gave different points about what counterculter is today. Back then you would associate counterculter
        with a subcultures that is against the norm. For example, punks, goths, gabbers, etc. I feel like now it is a bit harder to be truly 
        counterculter. The quote " To be truly counterculture in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform which
        may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self." I feel like its saying in order to be consider counterculter 
        these days you have to remove yourself from the internet not only through social media platforms but also your buying pattern and how you 
        receive information. Another interesting point is how power is used on the web from politics to these large tech companies. I guess I grew up when the internet
        was just starting and what you did back then wasn't as big of an impact than it is today.

      <p> "The Good Room" by Frank Chimero really resonated with me, these are things that I already think about, my realtionship with the internet. I read more books in the past year than I have ever in my life. Mainly
          beacuase I had to force myself to get off the screen. From the pandemic to the clown show at the white house, there was way to many distractions. Chimero mentions that reading a physical book is active unlike the passive
          consumption we do in front of the screen. The constant scrolling and the speed at which we read or look at things, as he calls it "violent delivery". The graph that he shows comparing the apps with time and happiness. It's so truly sad that the apps that we should
          be using to better our mental health are ones that we spend less than 20 mins on. It seems like there is a ton of regret after hours of mindlessly scrolling through a social app. I am definately guilty of it and also have full of regrets :( lol.

      <p> I made some changes to my journal. I thought it would be easier to have my entries all live in one page vs. clicking into a new page. I decided to go with the accordian which took a little time to figure out. The background color also changes depending on the time of day, so make sure to
          check back later! I spent so much time picking out the gradient colors than actually doing the css, lol.
          <br> The reading "Jodi's Infrastructure" by Alexander R. Galloway was interesting. I was actually speaking with a friend about "internet art" and whether it was considered "art" or not. I personally think it's beautiful the texutres that are created from using letters from the keyboard. It reminds me of this book, "The Art of Computer Designing" by Osamu Sato. 
          It's basically a collection of drawings created on the computer.
          <br> For my project, I definately started spiraling. I had an idea about creating a tarot reading website ( this was something I've always wanted to make) but I just don't know if it is right for the assignment. It might be something I try to do on my own.
          I had another idea of doing a website that showed the different pollution levels. This idea was sparked from looking at available APIs but also from speaking to my family in Thailand about how bad the pollution levels are getting. There are days where my nephews can't go outside during recess and having a air reader is normal, it seems like something that is just getting worse. I remember last time I went home, my eyes were burning when I stepped outside of the airport.
