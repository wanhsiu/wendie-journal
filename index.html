      <p> Hi! I'm Wendie. I'm Taiwanese, but grew up in Thailand. I moved to the US for college and have stayed here since.
        I currently live in Brooklyn, New York with my partner and dog (Roscoe). I received a BS in Fashion Design and Merchandising and have been working in 
        the fashion industry for some time, doing everything from styling, ecommerce, and production. I am currently in my 2nd semester in the AAS program in Communications Design
        I had my first experience with coding last semester in our Core Interaction class. I would still consider myself a beginnner. I am hopig to learn how to 
        create something dynamic and compelling on the web. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is an interesting <a href="https://x20xx.com/">website</a></p>

      <p> I'm trying to figure out what the best way to set up my jounral. The HTML and CSS review was really helpful. I feel like I need to better understand the language of coding instead of 
        just inspecting the page. After reading Paul Chan's "Letter to Young Artist During a Global Pandemic", I found his insights very interestig and made me think of creating in a different way. What really stood out to me in the reading is when he said " I'm never quite
        the same after making what ends up mattering the most". Its this idea what when we find meaning and pleasure in doing the things we love it will show in our work in that case it wouldn't be seen as "work". I also found his 
        lecture very intersting and learning about his journey as a designer.

      <p> I found the reading "The Cobweb" by Jill Lepore very interesting and scary at the same time. I didn't know about the Wayback Machine, but reading how it was able to save a screen shot of
        of a very serious matter (Strelkov's VKontakte post about downing the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17) really made me think about privacy and security of the web. I wondering how they are able to collect websites without
        asking and how they get away with archiving it. I used to have a xanga and myspace page back in the day and just thinking about the content and pictures I posted were super embarassing. I tried to look this up on the wayback but luckily it's gone! 
        I do love that you are able to go back and look at old websites that don't exist. It was really interesting to read about the development of the internet and how it started. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I loved looking through The Rhizome Anthology. There is sometime really interesting about using just html and creating something that reminds me of the "old" web. I also really loved
        how interactive it was by clicking through the pictures and words to create a narrative. The Form Art I also thought was really interesting and fun as well. A website doesn't need to be
        super fancy to be engaging.For the Love Anthology and lo and behold video, it didnt work for me.
        <br>
        <br>
        I learned a little about responsive design in our Interaction class last semester. I remember doing a project using media queary, I feel like after looking at more of the tutorials in the links
        provdided, I feel more conformatable using it. I was able to make this journal responsive which I'm really excited about.

      <p> The article "The internet didn't kill counterculture- you just won't find it on Instagram" by Caroline Busta was a 
        interesting read and it gave different points about what counterculter is today. Back then you would associate counterculter
        with a subcultures that is against the norm. For example, punks, goths, gabbers, etc. I feel like now it is a bit harder to be truly 
        counterculter. The quote " To be truly counterculture in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform which
        may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self." I feel like its saying in order to be consider counterculter 
        these days you have to remove yourself from the internet not only through social media platforms but also your buying pattern and how you 
        receive information. Another interesting point is how power is used on the web from politics to these large tech companies. I guess I grew up when the internet
        was just starting and what you did back then wasn't as big of an impact than it is today.

      <p> "The Good Room" by Frank Chimero really resonated with me, these are things that I already think about, my realtionship with the internet. I read more books in the past year than I have ever in my life. Mainly
          beacuase I had to force myself to get off the screen. From the pandemic to the clown show at the white house, there was way to many distractions. Chimero mentions that reading a physical book is active unlike the passive
          consumption we do in front of the screen. The constant scrolling and the speed at which we read or look at things, as he calls it "violent delivery". The graph that he shows comparing the apps with time and happiness. It's so truly sad that the apps that we should
          be using to better our mental health are ones that we spend less than 20 mins on. It seems like there is a ton of regret after hours of mindlessly scrolling through a social app. I am definately guilty of it and also have full of regrets :( lol.

    <div class="panel">
      <p> I made some changes to my journal. I thought it would be easier to have my entries all live in one page vs. clicking into a new page. I decided to go with the accordian which took a little time to figure out. The background color also changes depending on the time of day, so make sure to
          check back later! I spent so much time picking out the gradient colors than actually doing the css, lol.
          <br> The reading "Jodi's Infrastructure" by Alexander R. Galloway was interesting. I was actually speaking with a friend about "internet art" and whether it was considered "art" or not. I personally think it's beautiful the texutres that are created from using letters from the keyboard. It reminds me of this book, "The Art of Computer Designing" by Osamu Sato. 
          It's basically a collection of drawings created on the computer.
          <br> For my project, I definately started spiraling. I had an idea about creating a tarot reading website ( this was something I've always wanted to make) but I just don't know if it is right for the assignment. It might be something I try to do on my own.
          I had another idea of doing a website that showed the different pollution levels. This idea was sparked from looking at available APIs but also from speaking to my family in Thailand about how bad the pollution levels are getting. There are days where my nephews can't go outside during recess and having a air reader is normal, it seems like something that is just getting worse. I remember last time I went home, my eyes were burning when I stepped outside of the airport.

      <p> I found this reading quite interesting. I recently just made the choice to delete Instagram off my phone because I noticed myself scrolling aimlessly for hours. I was also feeling very overwhelmed by the current situation that was 
          happening with the AAPI community. After deleting it, my brain and thumb would automatically scroll to the second screen of my phone to the "antisocial" (ironically) folder where instagram used to live. I probably did this
          for a couple days, mindlessly scrolling to the app that no longer exists. I did this multiple times a day for maybe 3 days straight until I broke this habit. It was actually quite refreshing making this decision, I felt like I was in control and this app no longer became an addiction (let's see how long this last).
          In the section "Impersonal Computing", it made me think about the relationship I have with all my devices (ipad, iphone, and airmac), all of them being apple products of course. My phone is probably the device that I use and update the most,
          it is also where I spend the most time reading news articles and watch short videos. However, I'm still not a huge fan of writing emails or paying bills on my phone, so I guess I'm just like Graham's mother in that regard. Its interesting to see
          the evolution of the internet and seeing how we interact with it.
        <br>
        For my project, I had to rethink about my direction. I felt a little overwhelmed with all the things I had to learn and how I was going to put it all together. I decided to simplify the website and make it a website that will shows the air quality by
        picking out three out of the 8 compnents to show up on the screen. I want to find different nature landscape backgrounds where it will shuffle at random. I will need to learn how to use the API and also threejs! I'm also slowly trying to understand jquery as well.

    <div class="panel">
      <p> I really enjoyey this reading and started reading more about the American Artist. I found it intersting his way of connecting antiblackness and white supremecy through his art in a form of technology. He mentions that in the 70s computer screens were black but now when you open
          up a document or go on a search engine the backgrounds are usually white. I think its clever that he's using this medium as a way to to show his ideological assertion of whiteness as neutral. I found his piece No State, 2018 really impactful. It was a installation with over 
          a hundred shattered iphones placed on the floor. He contextualizes the black screen as a metaphore for Blackness: "Racial Slavery—which generated Blackness as a site of permanent extraction, gratuitous physical violence, and social death—provided the material and ideological basis 
          for the United States. Unsurprisingly, Silicon Valley advances this constitutive anti-blackness through its technological products and processes". The shattered screens and broken device is a metaphor for Black people and how their bodies circulate in the possession of the priviledge hands.
          I found this very thought provoking. This makes me think about representation and what it means to be POC in this industry.

      <p> After reading this I wanted to go back and try to play these games. The silent game kind of reminds of me of Sequence. It is also a game you play with a partner and you are supposed to try to connect 4 in a row without speaking to each other. It is a lot of luck but there is also a strategy to it.
          For Technical Universe it reminds me of the work of Sol Lewitt, where instructions are given to create a pattern.

      <p> This reading was interesting and brought in a lot of good points. I had no idea what skeuomorphic design was but I really like the meaning behind it- to make UI elements represent their real-world counterparts. I think it does make 
          a difference to think about the environment to really hone in on the experience. I also really liked the messaging section of the reading where it talks the different platforms where different users can interact via figma, sococo (or miro). It was my first time using miro last semester
          and there was something really nice about seeing the cursor move around as students try to upload their work. It felt like an interactive experience even though we were all online, as John Palmer puts it a concept of "presence".

      <p> Bratton's view on apps had me thinking about how important is to design a website that can also applied to mobile. Having a site that is responsive gives the website a wider range of fucntionality and usability. I felt like I had to work backwards when I was working on my website, because the responsive aspect came as an afterthought.
          I'm happy that I ended up having it working on mobile, just the way the particles looked on my the phone added a nice touch to the experience. I really never thought about how I rely on apps, here are my top 5 apps that I use on a daily basis. 1.) Dark Sky for the weather, great interface, the weather is mostly acccurate 2.) Instagram, my love/hate relationship 3.) Fi, a dog tracking app to track Roscoe's steps
        4.) Sonos, for my music 5.)Gmail, which I don't know why I do this on my phone.
