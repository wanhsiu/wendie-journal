                I found the reading "The Cobweb" by Jill Lepore very interesting and scary at the same time. I didn't know about the Wayback Machine, but reading how it was able to save a screen shot of
                of a very serious matter (Strelkov's VKontakte post about downing the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17) really made me think about privacy and security of the web. I wondering how they are able to collect websites without
                asking and how they get away with archiving it. I used to have a xanga and myspace page back in the day and just thinking about the content and pictures I posted were super embarassing. I tried to look this up on the wayback but luckily it's gone! 
                I do love that you are able to go back and look at old websites that don't exist. It was really interesting to read about the development of the internet and how it started.

                I loved looking through The Rhizome Anthology. There is sometime really interesting about using just html and creating something that reminds me of the "old" web. I also really loved
                how interactive it was by clicking through the pictures and words to create a narrative. The Form Art I also thought was really interesting and fun as well. A website doesn't need to be
                super fancy to be engaging.For the Love Anthology and lo and behold video, it didnt work for me.

                I learned a little about responsive design in our Interaction class last semester. I remember doing a project using media queary, I feel like after looking at more of the tutorials in the links
                provdided, I feel more conformatable using it. I was able to make this journal responsive which I'm really excited about.
