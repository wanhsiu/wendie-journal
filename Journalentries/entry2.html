                I'm trying to figure out what the best way to set up my jounral. The HTML and CSS review was really helpful. I feel like I need to better understand the language of coding instead of 
                just inspecting the page. After reading Paul Chan's "Letter to Young Artist During a Global Pandemic", I found his insights very interestig and made me think of creating in a different way. What really stood out to me in the reading is when he said " I'm never quite
                the same after making what ends up mattering the most". Its this idea what when we find meaning and pleasure in doing the things we love it will show in our work in that case it wouldn't be seen as "work". I also found his 
                lecture very intersting and learning about his journey as a designer.
