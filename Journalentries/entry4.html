               The article "The internet didn't kill counterculture- you just won't find it on Instagram" by Caroline Busta was a 
               interesting read and it gave different points about what counterculter is today. Back then you would associate counterculter
               with a subcultures that is against the norm. For example, punks, goths, gabbers, etc. I feel like now it is a bit harder to be truly 
               counterculter. The quote " To be truly counterculture in a time of tech hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform which
               may come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public online self." I feel like its saying in order to be consider counterculter 
               these days you have to remove yourself from the internet not only through social media platforms but also your buying pattern and how you 
               receive information. Another interesting point is how power is used on the web from politics to these large tech companies. I guess I grew up when the internet
               was just starting and what you did back then wasn't as big of an impact than it is today.
